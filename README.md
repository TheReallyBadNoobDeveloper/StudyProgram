StudyProgram (which is a place holder name), is a program that was made to help students study questions and answers. If you couldn't tell, this program is very much in the works right now. 

To set this up, open HTML and click on "Create.html", then create questions and answers. Once your done, press the "Download term list" button. 

To start studying the term list you created, open "Study.html", click on the "Browse.." button, find the question list (If this is your first one, it should be named "questions.js"), and open it.  Now just pick a mode and your set.
